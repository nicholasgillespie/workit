/**
 * Mixin: generateCustomProps
 * 
 * This mixin generates CSS custom properties (also known as CSS variables) based on a provided SCSS map and a prefix.
 * 
 * Parameters:
 * - $variable: A SCSS map where each key-value pair represents a CSS variable and its value.
 * - $prefix: A string that will be prepended to each key from the $variable map to form the CSS variable name.
 * 
 * The mixin iterates over the $variable map, and for each key-value pair, it generates a CSS variable. 
 * The CSS variable's name is formed by concatenating the $prefix and the key, and its value is the corresponding value from the map.
